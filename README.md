# hello-world

Hello fellow Earthnauts.
 
Although I may be a bit late to the game, I intend to gather every bit of knowledge on programming as I can. Most of my time is spent with a guitar in hand; however, I hope within the next couple of years I can reach closer to my goal of game design. Until then, I merely have basic understanding of programming languages. Here's to the future!
